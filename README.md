# Benchmarking AlphaFold 3 for Protein-Ligand Binding Prediction

This repository contains the code and analysis for the DATASCI 194B/294B final project, "Benchmarking AlphaFold 3 for Protein-Ligand Binding Prediction".

**Note:** This project is designed to be run in a **Google Colab** environment, accessing data directly from **Google Drive**.

## Project Overview

AlphaFold 3 (AF3) represents a significant advance in predicting protein-ligand interactions. This project systematically benchmarks AF3's protein-ligand binding prediction capabilities using a diverse test set of 50 protein-ligand pairs across 5 metabolite classes (ATP, NAD, heme, palmitate, and citrate). We analyze AF3's confidence metrics (ipTM, PAE) to discriminate between known binders and non-binders, achieving an overall ROC AUC of 0.925. The analysis reveals performance variations across ligand classes and proposes a statistical framework, including a reliability score, for interpreting AF3 predictions. This work provides guidance for applying AF3 in structural biology and drug discovery.

## Data Preparation and Acquisition (Google Drive)

* **Source Data:** The analysis relies on prediction results generated by the AlphaFold 3 Server.
* **Input Format:** The code expects the raw output `.zip` files obtained from running AF3 predictions for each protein-ligand pair.
* **Required Location & Structure:** These `.zip` files must be placed within your **Google Drive**. Inside your Drive, create a base folder (e.g., `alphafold3_data`) and within that, create subdirectories named after the ligand type (`atp`, `nad`, `heme`, `palmitate`, `citrate`). Place the corresponding `.zip` files into these ligand subdirectories. The code will look for files following a pattern like `[ligand_type]_[protein_id].zip`.
    *Example structure within Google Drive:*
    ```
    My Drive/
    └── alphafold3_data/  <-- This is your base data directory
        ├── atp/
        │   ├── atp_1.zip
        │   └── ... (up to atp_10.zip)
        ├── nad/
        │   └── ... (up to nad_10.zip)
        ├── heme/
        │   └── ...
        ├── palmitate/
        │   └── ...
        └── citrate/
            └── ...
    ```
* **Dataset Details:** The dataset comprises 50 protein-ligand pairs: 5 ligand types x 10 protein targets per ligand (2 known binders, 8 non-binders). Known binders are specified in the `binding_pairs` dictionary in the code.

## Requirements and Installation (Google Colab)

* **Environment:** Google Colab.
* **Packages:** The analysis uses standard Python data science libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `tqdm`). These are typically pre-installed in Colab environments. The `google.colab` package is used for Drive access.
* **Tracking:** A `requirements.txt` file is included primarily for dependency tracking purposes.
    ```
    # requirements.txt
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scipy
    tqdm
    ```

## Running Instructions (Google Colab)

1.  **Prepare Data in Google Drive:** Ensure your AlphaFold 3 output `.zip` files are organized in your Google Drive as described under "Data Preparation and Acquisition".
2.  **Open Notebook in Colab:** Upload the `alphafold3_project.ipynb` notebook to your Google Drive, or open it directly from GitHub using the Colab integration (`File -> Open notebook -> GitHub` tab).
3.  **Configure Data Path:** In the notebook, locate the first code cell (marked `# === Configuration Cell ===`). **Edit the `BASE_DATA_DIRECTORY` variable** to match the exact path to your base data folder *within your Google Drive* (e.g., `/content/drive/MyDrive/alphafold3_data` if your folder is named `alphafold3_data` and is in the main "My Drive" area).
4.  **Run Notebook:** Execute the cells sequentially.
    * You will be prompted to authorize Colab to access your Google Drive when the `drive.mount` cell runs.
    * The `run_analysis()` function at the end will process all data from your Drive, generate plots (saving them to the specified Drive path or current Colab instance directory if modified), calculate statistics, and save summary CSV files (likely also to your Drive, depending on save paths used).

Example configuration within the notebook:
```python
# === Configuration Cell ===
BASE_DATA_DIRECTORY = '/content/drive/MyDrive/alphafold3_data' # Path within mounted Drive
# ==========================
